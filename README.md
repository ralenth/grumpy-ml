Notebooks with various machine learning tasks, for example neural network implementation from scratch.

This repository consists of three main categories of notebooks:
* **bioinformatics** - machine learning with real-life biology 
  application,
  
* **from_scratch** - implementation of various techniques using
`numpy`,
  
* **standard** - models built using standard machine learning packages
such as `tensorflow`.
  

### Bioinformatics notebooks
1. _gene_expression_ - clustering genes based on their expression.
Used techniques: PCA, nearest neighbors, k-means, t-SNE. Done as
   homework for Modelling Complex Biology Systems (MCBS) course,
   

### From scratch notebooks

1. _numerical_derivative_ - implementation of numerical derivatives,
SVD and page-rank algorithms. Done as homework for numerical analysis
   for the AI (NA4AI) course,
   
2. _descent_without_gradient_ - visualization of finding critical
points using descent without gradient algorithm. Done as homework for
   NA4AI course,
   
3. _neural_network_ - implementation of neural network, as well as
**Adam optimizer**. Trained on MNIST. Done as homework for NA4AI 
   course,

### Standard notebooks

1. _cnn_fashion_mnist_ - simple CNN Fashion MNIST classifier in 
   `tensorflow`. Done as homework for MCBS course,
   
2. _vae_mnist_ - Varational Autoencoder for MNIST data in `tensorflow`.
Provided with visualization of interpolation between different numbers.
   Done as homework for MCBS course,
